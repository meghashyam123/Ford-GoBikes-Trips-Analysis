        "1. Optimized Bike Distribution:\n",
        "Knowing that the top stations (especially transit hubs) see the highest usage, the business can focus on redistributing bikes to these areas during peak times (e.g., morning rush hour or after office hours). This ensures higher bike availability at locations with the most demand, which can increase customer satisfaction and ride frequency.\n",

This could frustrate customers, especially if they are unable to start their ride due to insufficient bikes, leading to a negative brand experience and potential loss of customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Potential for Market Saturation:\n",
        "The high concentration of trips in a few locations might indicate that the service is saturating certain high-demand areas. If the service doesn‚Äôt expand or diversify into other regions, it might face diminishing returns in already dense areas, slowing down overall growth.\n",
